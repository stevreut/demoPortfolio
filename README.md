# CHAKANA demo page

## Description

A project whose goal is to create a gateway landing page for accessing various tools and sites I have created or will have created during
my time as a student in the University of Pennsylvania Full-Stack Boot Camp.  At present, not all links on the site create lead to
project sites, as most have not yet been developed, but that is, hopefully, subject to change in the coming weeks.

- In completing this project, the following have been learned:
    - Use of semantic elements in HTML
    - Use of element styles in CSS
        - grid
        - flexbox
        - media queries
        - etc.

- Access to GitHub repository [github.com/stevreut/demoPortfolio](https://github.com/stevreut/demoPortfolio)
